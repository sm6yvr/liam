  2017-06-06 Roberth Andersson:
             - Restructured the file and made differens sections of parameters.
             - Added setup debug mode.
  2014-12-12 Jonas Forsell:
            - Initial version.

/* SETUP AND DEBUG MODE .
   First time you start your mover the code is configured to run in debug mode.
   In that mode you can send different commands to the mover to test different functions.
   You can also see some values reported by the sensors. You need probably to tweek some
   of the parameters in this file and when you are done remove or comment out this line to
   run your mover in real mode. */
